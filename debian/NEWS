fonts-knda (2:1.2) unstable; urgency=low

   From this version the fonts-knda-extra package dependency is
   removed. fonts-knda-extra will be requested for removal from archive as
   the fonts in it Kedage and Malige are now forked and maintained by
   active upstream as Gubbi and Navilu. This fonts are part of
   fonts-gubbi and fonts-navilu which are already dependency for this
   package.
